**My Background** - My goal is to provide insights about data science, bioinformatics, human-subject study design, and longitudinal health tracking which I have gained through years of managing all aspects of numerous studies on tens of thousands of people. My journey started at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with B.S. in Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, & Biophysics; solidified with a Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University in Human Genetics and thesis focused on host genetic influence on the microbiome; and expanded as a NIH Postdocotoral Fellow for five years researching under Dr. Mike Snyder the Director of Stanford University Genetics Department.
