## Exploring Data Science Underlying Personalized Healthcare
Lessons from real world microbiome, wearable, and other multiomic studies of human participants.

**Research techniques particularly focused on:** 
* `Respecting and understanding human study participants` (how to run a good study)
* `Full stack data science` (taking raw data to ML inference generating UIs)
* `Longitudinal health monitoring` (measures over time)
* `Prediction of anomalous health events` (illness onset, interventions...)
* `Causal inference of statistics and machine learning` (what causes health changes)
* `Multiomics & multimodal` (combining genetics, metabolomics, wearables, surveys, clinical...)
