## Exploring Data Science Underlying Personalized Healthcare
Lessons from real world microbiome, wearable, and other multiomic studies of human participants.

**Research techniques particularly focused on:** 
* Respecting and understanding human study participants (how to run a good study)
* Longitudinal health monitoring (measures over time)
* Prediction of anomalous health events (illness onset, interventions...)
* Causal inference of statistics and machine learning (what causes health changes)
* Multiomics & multimodal (combining genetics, metabolomics, wearables, surveys, clinical...)
