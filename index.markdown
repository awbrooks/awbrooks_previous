## Exploring Data Science Underlying Personalized Healthcare
Lessons from real world microbiome, wearable, and other multiomic studies of human participants.

**Background** - My goal is to provide insights about data science, bioinformatics, human-subject study design, and longitudinal health tracking which I have gained through years of managing all aspects of numerous studies on tens of thousands of people. My journey started at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with B.S. in Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, & Biophysics; solidified with a Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University in Human Genetics and thesis focused on host genetic influence on the microbiome; and expanded as a NIH Postdocotoral Fellow for five years researching under Dr. Mike Snyder the Director of Stanford University Genetics Department.    

**Research techniques particularly focused on:** 
* Respecting and understanding human study participants (how to run a good study)
* Longitudinal health monitoring (measures over time)
* Prediction of anomalous health events (illness onset, interventions...)
* Causal inference of statistics and machine learning (what causes health changes)
* Multiomics & multimodal (combining genetics, metabolomics, wearables, surveys, clinical...)
